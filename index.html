            Dreaming is our souls voice from within.
            Connecting our brain and hearts true feelings.
            Dreams are the voice, that needs to be heard.
            Not like just any, but a black n white picture.
            The details may seem blurry to ones eye.
            But another sees color, in a different light.
            The picture is printed out there before you.
            It's your decision, on what dreams you make come true.
